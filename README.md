# Firebase Asynchronous Data Handling

This repository demonstrates a common error when working with Firebase: attempting to access data from a document snapshot before the data has fully loaded.  This can lead to crashes or unexpected behavior in your application.

The `bug.js` and `bug.swift` files show examples of code that will throw an error. The `bugSolution.js` and `bugSolution.swift` files provide the corrected versions, showcasing the proper use of asynchronous programming techniques to handle data loading.

## How to Reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run the buggy code example (`bug.js` or `bug.swift`).
3. Observe the error.
4. Run the corrected code example (`bugSolution.js` or `bugSolution.swift`).
5. Verify that the data is accessed correctly after the loading is complete.

## Solution

The key to resolving this issue is to always handle data loading asynchronously. Use promises in JavaScript or async/await pattern, and use completion handlers in Swift to ensure that you only attempt to access data once it has been fully retrieved from Firebase.
